==========

What is this?
-------------

What started as a Intel 8080 emulator turned into a Altair 8800 emulator with associated hardware for a front panel.

Buildin
-------

WIP. Not complete, not correct.

Passes Kelly Smith test and cputest.com when running on x86. Runs CP/M and all kinds of BASIC I could find. Altair DOS not working for some reason (complains about insufficient memory). Support for 88-DCDD. No tape or cassette.

~~Some serious bugs causing cold boots in CP/M when running on atmega328.~~

State of atmega328 build same as x86.
